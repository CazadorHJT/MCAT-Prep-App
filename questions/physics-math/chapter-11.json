      "options": ["A. Blood pressure measurements", "B. The type of treatment (drug vs. placebo)", "C. The number of participants", "D. The duration of the study"],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The independent variable is the factor that the researcher manipulates. In this case, the researcher is manipulating whether participants receive the drug or the placebo, making the type of treatment the independent variable. Blood pressure is the dependent variable that is measured as an outcome.",

      "options": ["A. Sleep duration", "B. Memory test scores", "C. Random assignment", "D. Number of participants in each group"],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The dependent variable is the outcome that is measured and is expected to change based on the independent variable. Memory test scores are measured as the outcome of the experiment, making them the dependent variable. Sleep duration is the independent variable that is manipulated.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A control group provides a baseline for comparison, allowing researchers to determine whether changes in the dependent variable are due to the independent variable or other factors. Without a control group, it would be difficult to attribute observed effects to the treatment being studied.",

      "options": ["A. Double-blind study", "B. Single-blind study", "C. Open-label study", "D. Crossover study"],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In a single-blind study, the participants do not know whether they are receiving the treatment or placebo, but the researchers do know. In a double-blind study, neither the participants nor the researchers know who receives which treatment. This design helps reduce participant bias.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This is a classic example of a confounding variable. Hot weather (temperature) is a third variable that causes both increased ice cream sales and more swimming, which leads to more drowning deaths.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Random assignment helps ensure that experimental groups are equivalent before treatment by distributing both known and unknown participant characteristics evenly across groups. This reduces the likelihood that group differences in outcomes are due to pre-existing differences rather than the treatment.",

      "correct_answer": "B",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In an observational study, the researcher observes and records data without manipulating any variables. This contrasts with experimental studies where the researcher actively manipulates the independent variable. Observational studies are useful when manipulation would be unethical or impractical.",

      "options": ["A. Case study", "B. Correlational study", "C. Experimental study", "D. Meta-analysis"],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This is an experimental study because the researcher is manipulating the independent variable (teaching method) and measuring its effect on the dependent variable (test scores).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Statistical power is the probability that a study will detect an effect when there truly is one to detect (i.e., correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis). Power is influenced by sample size, effect size, and significance level. Low power increases the risk of Type II errors (failing to detect real effects).",

      "options": ["A. Dependent variable", "B. Independent variable", "C. Confounding variable", "D. Control variable"],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Sleep duration is a confounding variable because it is associated with both the independent variable (coffee consumption) and the dependent variable (reaction time). It could provide an alternative explanation for any observed relationship between coffee and reaction time.",

      "options": ["A. Test-retest reliability", "B. Internal consistency", "C. Validity", "D. Inter-rater reliability"],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Validity refers to whether a test measures what it is intended to measure. There are several types of validity including construct validity, content validity, and criterion validity. A test can be reliable without being valid, but a valid test must also be reliable.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In a double-blind study, neither the participants nor the researchers who interact with them know which treatment each participant receives.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Increasing sample size increases statistical power. Larger samples provide more precise estimates of population parameters and make it easier to detect true effects.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Internal validity refers to the degree to which a study can establish a causal relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Hawthorne effect occurs when participants modify their behavior because they know they are being observed, not because of the experimental treatment.
