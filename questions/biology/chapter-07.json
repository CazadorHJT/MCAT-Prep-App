      "explanation": "The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the systemic circulation via the superior vena cava (from the upper body) and inferior vena cava (from the lower body). The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins. The ventricles pump blood out of the heart rather than receiving blood from the vena cavae.",

      "explanation": "The tricuspid valve (with three cusps) is the atrioventricular valve located between the right atrium and right ventricle.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "During ventricular systole, the ventricles contract and pressure increases. This causes the AV valves (tricuspid and mitral) to close, preventing backflow to the atria, while the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) open to allow blood ejection into the arteries. The first heart sound (S1) is produced by AV valve closure.",

      "explanation": "The first heart sound (S1 or 'lub') is caused by the closure of the atrioventricular valves (tricuspid and mitral) at the beginning of ventricular systole. The second heart sound (S2 or 'dub') is caused by closure of the semilunar valves at the beginning of ventricular diastole. Valve opening and atrial contraction do not produce significant sounds.",

      "explanation": "The sinoatrial (SA) node is the primary pacemaker of the heart, located in the right atrium. It has the fastest intrinsic firing rate (60-100 bpm) and initiates each heartbeat. The AV node, Bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers can serve as backup pacemakers if the SA node fails, but they have slower intrinsic rates.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The AV node delay (approximately 0.1 seconds) allows time for atrial contraction to complete and for the ventricles to fill with blood before ventricular contraction begins. This ensures efficient cardiac output. The delay does not increase heart rate, prevent SA node firing, or directly affect valve closure.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "If the SA node fails, the AV node becomes the pacemaker because it has the next fastest intrinsic firing rate (40-60 bpm). The Bundle of His and Purkinje fibers have slower intrinsic rates (20-40 bpm) and would only take over if both SA and AV nodes fail. The coronary sinus is not part of the conduction system.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cardiac output (CO) equals stroke volume (SV) multiplied by heart rate (HR): CO = SV x HR. It represents the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. Blood pressure equals cardiac output times peripheral resistance. Blood volume is the total amount of blood in the body.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Cardiac output = stroke volume x heart rate = 70 mL x 75 bpm = 5,250 mL/min = 5.25 L/min. This is a typical resting cardiac output for an adult. Options B and C represent the same value in different units, so both are correct.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Frank-Starling mechanism states that increased venous return stretches the ventricles, which increases the force of contraction and thus stroke volume. This allows the heart to automatically adjust its output to match venous return. This mechanism ensures that the heart pumps out all the blood it receives.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Systolic blood pressure is the maximum pressure in the arteries during ventricular contraction (systole). Diastolic blood pressure is the minimum pressure during ventricular relaxation (diastole). Atrial contraction contributes minimally to arterial pressure.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The cerebellum coordinates movement and balance but does not regulate blood pressure. Blood pressure is regulated by baroreceptors (detecting pressure changes), the RAAS (controlling fluid balance), and the autonomic nervous system (adjusting heart rate and vessel tone). The medulla oblongata, not cerebellum, contains cardiovascular control centers.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "When baroreceptors detect high blood pressure, they trigger increased parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation and decreased sympathetic stimulation, which slows heart rate and dilates blood vessels, lowering blood pressure. Renin is released when blood pressure is low, not high, to activate the RAAS and increase pressure.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The RAAS is activated when blood pressure is low. The kidneys release renin, which converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, then ACE converts it to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and stimulates aldosterone release, which increases sodium and water retention, raising blood pressure.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Mature red blood cells lack a nucleus (and other organelles), which allows more space for hemoglobin and maximizes oxygen-carrying capacity.

      "explanation": "A right shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve (decreased oxygen affinity) occurs with increased temperature, increased CO2, decreased pH (more acidic), and increased 2,3-BPG. These conditions occur in active tissues and promote oxygen unloading. Decreased temperature, decreased CO2, and increased pH cause a left shift.",
