        "D. Cells arise only from preexisting cells"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The original cell theory had three tenets: (1) all living things are composed of cells, (2) the cell is the basic functional unit of life, and (3) cells arise only from preexisting cells. The fourth tenet about DNA as genetic material was added later through advances in molecular biology. Options A, B, and D are all original tenets.",

        "A. his microscope lacked sufficient magnification",
        "B. cork consists of desiccated nonliving cells",
        "C. plant cells do not contain nuclei",
        "D. the cells were too small to observe"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cork consists of dead, desiccated (dried out) plant cells. Because these cells were no longer living, they lacked the cytoplasmic contents including nuclei and organelles that would be visible in living cells. Hooke's microscope was capable of viewing cellular structures, and plant cells do contain nuclei. The issue was not cell size but cell viability.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Viruses violate the third tenet of cell theory (cells arise only from preexisting cells) because they cannot reproduce on their own and must invade host cells. They also violate the fourth tenet because some viruses use RNA rather than DNA as their genetic material. While viruses do lack cell membranes, this is not the primary reason they are excluded from the definition of life.",
