        "A. Mouth, stomach, esophagus, small intestine, large intestine",
        "B. Mouth, esophagus, stomach, large intestine, small intestine",
        "C. Mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine",
        "D. Mouth, pharynx, stomach, esophagus, small intestine"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The correct order of the digestive tract is mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Food enters through the mouth, travels down the esophagus to the stomach, then moves through the small intestine where most absorption occurs, and finally into the large intestine for water absorption and waste elimination.",

        "C. Carbohydrates",
        "D. Nucleic acids"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Salivary amylase (also called ptyalin) begins the digestion of carbohydrates, specifically breaking down starch into maltose and dextrins. This enzyme works optimally at the neutral pH found in the mouth. Protein digestion begins in the stomach with pepsin, lipid digestion primarily occurs in the small intestine, and nucleic acid digestion involves nucleases in the small intestine.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pepsin is secreted as the inactive zymogen pepsinogen to prevent autodigestion of the chief cells that produce it. Pepsinogen is activated to pepsin only when it encounters the acidic environment of the stomach lumen (pH 1.5-3.5). This protective mechanism ensures that the powerful proteolytic enzyme does not damage the cells that synthesize it.",

      "explanation": "The submucosa is a connective tissue layer that contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and the submucosal (Meissner's) nerve plexus. The mucosa is the innermost layer that contacts food. The muscularis externa contains smooth muscle for peristalsis. The serosa is the outermost protective layer.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Peristalsis consists of coordinated waves of circular and longitudinal smooth muscle contraction that propel food (bolus) through the gastrointestinal tract. This involuntary movement begins in the esophagus and continues through the entire digestive system. Segmentation, not peristalsis, is responsible for mixing food with enzymes.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The small intestine consists of three sections: the duodenum (receives chyme from the stomach and secretions from the pancreas and liver), the jejunum (primary site of nutrient absorption), and the ileum (absorbs vitamin B12, bile salts, and remaining nutrients). The duodenum is approximately 25 cm long, while the jejunum and ileum together are about 6 meters.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Villi are finger-like projections of the intestinal mucosa, and microvilli are microscopic projections on the surface of enterocytes (intestinal absorptive cells). Together, they dramatically increase the surface area of the small intestine (to approximately 200 square meters), maximizing nutrient absorption efficiency.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Brush border enzymes are embedded in the plasma membrane of the microvilli (brush border) of intestinal epithelial cells. These enzymes include maltase, sucrase, lactase, and peptidases, which complete the final stages of carbohydrate and protein digestion. They act on the products of luminal digestion to produce absorbable monosaccharides and amino acids.",

        "D. Amylase"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Lactose intolerance occurs due to a deficiency of lactase, the brush border enzyme that breaks down lactose (milk sugar) into glucose and galactose. Without sufficient lactase, lactose remains undigested and passes into the large intestine where bacteria ferment it, producing gas, bloating, and diarrhea. Maltase breaks down maltose, sucrase breaks down sucrose, and amylase breaks down starch.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The exocrine pancreas secretes bicarbonate (to neutralize acidic chyme from the stomach) and digestive enzymes including trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatic amylase, pancreatic lipase, and nucleases. These secretions enter the duodenum through the pancreatic duct. Bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. HCl and intrinsic factor are from stomach parietal cells.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Trypsinogen, the inactive form of trypsin secreted by the pancreas, is activated by enterokinase (enteropeptidase), an enzyme embedded in the brush border of duodenal enterocytes. Once activated, trypsin can then activate other pancreatic zymogens (chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase, proelastase).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Bile is produced by hepatocytes in the liver and is composed of bile salts, bilirubin, cholesterol, and phospholipids. The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile but does not produce it. When fatty food enters the duodenum, cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulates gallbladder contraction to release bile into the duodenum for fat emulsification.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Bile salts emulsify fats, breaking large fat globules into smaller droplets (micelles). This increases the surface area available for pancreatic lipase to chemically digest triglycerides into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Bile does not chemically digest fats - that is the role of lipase. Bicarbonate neutralizes stomach acid. Enterokinase activates pancreatic enzymes.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Secretin is released by S cells in the duodenal mucosa when acidic chyme (pH < 4.5) enters from the stomach. Secretin stimulates the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid to neutralize the acid, and inhibits gastric acid secretion. CCK is released in response to fatty acids and amino acids.

      "explanation": "CCK is released by I cells in the duodenum in response to fats and proteins. It stimulates gallbladder contraction (releasing bile), pancreatic enzyme secretion, and produces a feeling of satiety (fullness). CCK actually inhibits gastric emptying and gastric acid secretion, not stimulates it. Gastrin is the primary hormone that stimulates gastric acid secretion.",
