      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Neutrophils are phagocytic white blood cells that are part of the innate immune system. They provide rapid, non-specific defense against pathogens. T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes are components of the adaptive immune system, which provides specific, targeted responses. Plasma cells are differentiated B cells that produce antibodies, also part of adaptive immunity.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The skin does not produce antibodies; antibody production is a function of the adaptive immune system, specifically by plasma cells derived from B lymphocytes. The skin provides innate immunity through physical barriers (keratinized epithelium), chemical barriers (antimicrobial peptides like defensins, and acidic sebum), and the normal microbiota that outcompete pathogens.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The inflammatory response involves vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), which increases blood flow to the affected area causing redness and heat. Increased vascular permeability allows plasma proteins and leukocytes to move into tissues. Leukocyte migration (extravasation) brings immune cells to the site of infection or injury.

      "explanation": "The complement system does not produce immunoglobulins (antibodies); that is the function of plasma cells. The complement system enhances immunity through opsonization (coating pathogens to enhance phagocytosis), forming the membrane attack complex (MAC) that lyses pathogens, and producing anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a) that recruit inflammatory cells and promote inflammation.",

      "explanation": "MHC class II molecules are expressed primarily on professional antigen-presenting cells: dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells.
