      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Human somatic cells are diploid (2n) and contain 46 chromosomes throughout most of the cell cycle. In G1, before DNA replication, each chromosome consists of a single chromatid. The number 23 represents the haploid number found in germ cells. After S phase, there are still 46 chromosomes, but each consists of 2 sister chromatids (92 chromatids total).",
