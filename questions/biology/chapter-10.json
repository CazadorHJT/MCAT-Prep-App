        "C. Collecting duct",
        "D. Renal pelvis"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting duct. While the glomerulus performs filtration, it is only one component of the nephron. The collecting duct receives filtrate from multiple nephrons, and the renal pelvis collects urine before it enters the ureter.",

      "options": [
        "A. It allows blood to bypass the glomerulus when needed",
        "B. It maintains high hydrostatic pressure for filtration",
        "C. It prevents backflow of filtered substances",
        "D. It increases the oxygen delivery to nephron cells"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The presence of two arterioles (afferent and efferent) rather than an arteriole-venule arrangement maintains high hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillaries. This high pressure is essential for driving glomerular filtration. The efferent arteriole has a smaller diameter than the afferent arteriole, which further increases pressure within the glomerulus.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Plasma proteins are too large to pass through the glomerular filtration membrane under normal conditions. The filtration membrane allows passage of water, ions, glucose, amino acids, urea, and other small molecules while retaining blood cells and most proteins.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is the site of the majority of reabsorption, recovering approximately 65-70% of the filtered water, sodium, and other solutes. This includes nearly all filtered glucose and amino acids under normal conditions. The PCT has microvilli to increase surface area and numerous mitochondria to power active transport.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Glucosuria (glucose in urine) with normal blood glucose suggests a defect in the reabsorption mechanism rather than excess glucose overwhelming the transport maximum. The PCT uses SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) and GLUT2 carriers to reabsorb glucose. Diabetes mellitus would cause high blood glucose. ADH affects water reabsorption, not glucose. Glomerulonephritis would cause protein in urine.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The thin descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to water but impermeable to sodium and other solutes. As filtrate descends into the hypertonic medulla, water moves out by osmosis, concentrating the tubular fluid. This is a critical step in the countercurrent multiplication system that allows the kidney to produce concentrated urine.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The thick ascending limb actively transports NaCl out of the tubular fluid but is impermeable to water. This creates a hypertonic medullary interstitium while making the tubular fluid progressively more dilute (hypotonic) as it ascends. This is why it's called the diluting segment. The water cannot follow the solutes, so the remaining fluid becomes diluted.",

      "explanation": "Loop diuretics (such as furosemide) specifically inhibit the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This prevents the establishment of the medullary concentration gradient, significantly reducing the kidney's ability to concentrate urine.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "ADH (also called vasopressin) is synthesized in the hypothalamus but is released from the posterior pituitary gland. The posterior pituitary stores ADH in nerve terminals and releases it in response to signals from hypothalamic osmoreceptors detecting increased blood osmolarity or decreased blood volume. The anterior pituitary releases different hormones like FSH, LH, TSH, and ACTH.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "ADH binds to V2 receptors on the basolateral membrane of collecting duct principal cells, triggering a cAMP cascade that causes aquaporin-2 water channels to be inserted into the apical (luminal) membrane. This increases water permeability, allowing water to move from the tubular fluid into the hypertonic medullary interstitium and back into the blood.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidneys fail to respond to ADH despite normal or elevated ADH levels. This results in inability to concentrate urine, causing polyuria and polydipsia with high serum osmolarity. Central diabetes insipidus involves inadequate ADH production. SIADH causes excess water retention and hyponatremia. Diabetes mellitus would show elevated blood glucose.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid produced by the zona glomerulosa, the outermost layer of the adrenal cortex. The zona fasciculata produces glucocorticoids (cortisol), and the zona reticularis produces androgens. The adrenal medulla produces catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine).

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Aldosterone acts on principal cells of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. It does this by upregulating Na+/K+ ATPase pumps and epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). While this indirectly promotes water retention (water follows sodium), ADH is the primary hormone for direct water reabsorption.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The RAAS cascade begins when renin (released from juxtaglomerular cells) cleaves angiotensinogen (from the liver) to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, primarily in lungs) then converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex, among other effects like vasoconstriction.",
