        "C. Cardiac muscle",
        "D. All striated muscle types"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cardiac muscle is uniquely characterized by intercalated discs, which are specialized cell junctions containing gap junctions that allow electrical signals to pass rapidly between adjacent cardiac muscle cells. This creates a functional syncytium that allows the heart to contract in a coordinated manner. Skeletal muscle lacks intercalated discs and relies on neuromuscular junctions for stimulation. Smooth muscle may have gap junctions but does not have intercalated discs.",

        "A. Actin filaments shorten",
        "B. Myosin filaments shorten",
        "C. Sarcomeres shorten while filament lengths remain constant",
        "D. Both actin and myosin filaments shorten"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The sliding filament theory states that during muscle contraction, the thin (actin) and thick (myosin) filaments slide past each other, causing the sarcomere to shorten. Importantly, the individual filaments themselves do not change length. The shortening of the sarcomere results from increased overlap between the actin and myosin filaments as they slide past one another, powered by the cross-bridge cycle.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Z-line (or Z-disc) serves as the anchoring point for the thin actin filaments at each end of the sarcomere. The sarcomere is defined as the region between two Z-lines. Thick myosin filaments are not directly attached to the Z-line; they are held in place by titin proteins that span from the Z-line to the M-line. Calcium is stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, not the Z-line.",

      "explanation": "The I band contains only thin (actin) filaments and shortens during contraction as the thin filaments slide further into the A band. The A band contains thick filaments and remains constant in length during contraction. The H zone contains only thick filaments and also shortens during contraction. The M line is a structural element at the center of the sarcomere that anchors thick filaments.",

        "D. Acetylcholine is released"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "When calcium binds to troponin C, it causes a conformational change in the troponin-tropomyosin complex that shifts tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin filaments. This exposure allows myosin heads to bind to actin and initiate the cross-bridge cycle. ATP hydrolysis occurs before this step, acetylcholine release occurs earlier at the neuromuscular junction, and sarcomere contraction is the end result of the entire process.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter released at the neuromuscular junction by motor neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction. When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, ACh is released into the synaptic cleft, binds to nicotinic receptors on the motor end plate, and triggers depolarization of the muscle cell membrane.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Type I (slow-twitch) muscle fibers are highly resistant to fatigue and are adapted for endurance activities like marathon running. They have high myoglobin content, numerous mitochondria, and rely primarily on aerobic metabolism. Type II (fast-twitch) fibers are better suited for explosive, powerful movements like sprinting, powerlifting, and jumping because they can generate more force quickly but fatigue more rapidly.",

They are large, multinucleated cells that resorb bone by secreting acid and proteolytic enzymes. Osteoblasts, not osteoclasts, are derived from mesenchymal stem cells.

      "explanation": "Osteoblasts are the bone-forming cells responsible for synthesizing and depositing new bone matrix (osteoid), which later becomes mineralized. Osteoclasts resorb bone, breaking it down. Osteocytes are mature bone cells derived from osteoblasts that have become embedded in the bone matrix; they maintain bone tissue but do not actively deposit new matrix.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is released in response to low blood calcium levels and acts to increase calcium by stimulating osteoclast activity (bone resorption), increasing calcium reabsorption in the kidneys, and promoting vitamin D activation. Calcitonin has the opposite effect, lowering blood calcium by inhibiting osteoclasts. Cortisol and thyroid hormone have other metabolic functions but are not primary regulators of calcium homeostasis.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Smooth muscle contracts more slowly than skeletal muscle but can maintain contractions for extended periods without fatigue, making it ideal for functions like maintaining blood vessel tone and moving food through the digestive tract. Smooth muscle lacks the organized sarcomere structure that creates striations in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle is involuntary, controlled by the autonomic nervous system, hormones, and local factors.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "When ATP binds to the myosin head, it causes a conformational change that reduces myosin's affinity for actin, allowing the myosin head to detach from the actin filament. This is a critical step in the cross-bridge cycle. ATP hydrolysis then re-cocks the myosin head for another cycle. The power stroke occurs when phosphate is released after myosin binds to actin. Calcium release is initiated by the action potential, not ATP binding.",

      "explanation": "The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a specialized form of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells that stores calcium ions and releases them in response to an action potential. When an action potential travels along the T-tubules, it triggers calcium release from the SR, initiating muscle contraction. The SR also contains Ca2+-ATPase pumps that actively pump calcium back into the SR during relaxation.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The A band contains the entire length of the thick (myosin) filaments and remains constant in length during contraction because the thick filaments do not change length. The A band appears dark under polarized light microscopy. During contraction, thin filaments slide further into the A band, but the A band itself does not shorten.

      "explanation": "Titin is a giant elastic protein that spans from the Z-line to the M-line, connecting the thick filaments to the sarcomere structure. It acts as a molecular spring, providing passive elasticity to the muscle and preventing overstretching. Nebulin runs along the thin filaments and helps determine their length.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme located in the synaptic cleft that rapidly hydrolyzes acetylcholine into acetate and choline, terminating the signal at the neuromuscular junction.
