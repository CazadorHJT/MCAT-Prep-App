        "C. 3:1",
        "D. 2:1"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "When two heterozygous individuals (Aa) are crossed, the genotypic ratio is 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa. However, since A is completely dominant over a, both AA and Aa individuals express the dominant phenotype. This results in a phenotypic ratio of 3 dominant : 1 recessive (3:1). The 1:2:1 ratio represents the genotypic ratio, not the phenotypic ratio.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A testcross is used to determine the genotype of an individual expressing a dominant phenotype. If the dominant parent were homozygous (AA), all offspring would be Aa and express the dominant phenotype. Since half the offspring express the recessive phenotype, this indicates the cross was Aa x aa, yielding a 1:1 ratio of Aa (dominant) to aa (recessive). Therefore, the parent must be heterozygous (Aa).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Law of Segregation states that the two alleles for each gene separate (segregate) during gamete formation (meiosis), so each gamete receives only one allele. This occurs during anaphase I when homologous chromosomes separate. Option A describes the Law of Independent Assortment. Option C describes dominance but is not a law.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In incomplete dominance, the heterozygote shows an intermediate phenotype. Crossing two pink (RW) flowers yields: 1 RR (red) : 2 RW (pink) : 1 WW (white). Unlike complete dominance where heterozygotes and homozygous dominant individuals look the same, in incomplete dominance each genotype produces a distinct phenotype, so the phenotypic ratio matches the genotypic ratio of 1:2:1.",

      "explanation": "Recombination frequency indicates the percentage of recombinant offspring produced due to crossing over. A frequency of 8% means the genes are 8 map units apart and relatively close together on the same chromosome. Genes on different chromosomes (A) or that assort independently (B) would show 50% recombination.
