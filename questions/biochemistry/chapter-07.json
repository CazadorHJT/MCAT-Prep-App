      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle by condensing with oxaloacetate to form citrate. This reaction also produces NADH and releases CO2. Oxaloacetate is the acceptor molecule in the cycle, citrate is the first product of the cycle, and alpha-ketoglutarate is an intermediate.",
