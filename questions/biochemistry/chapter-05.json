        "D. A nucleotide contains ribose only, while a nucleoside can contain deoxyribose"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A nucleoside consists of a nitrogenous base attached to a pentose sugar (ribose or deoxyribose). A nucleotide is a nucleoside with one or more phosphate groups attached to the 5' carbon of the sugar. This phosphate group is essential for forming the phosphodiester bonds in nucleic acid polymers.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Adenine and guanine are purines, which have a characteristic double-ring (bicyclic) structure consisting of a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, and uracil) have single-ring structures. The mnemonic 'PURe As Gold' helps remember that purines are adenine and guanine.",

      "explanation": "Uracil is a pyrimidine found in RNA but not in DNA. In DNA, thymine replaces uracil. Uracil lacks the methyl group present on thymine. Cytosine is found in both DNA and RNA, and adenine is a purine, not a pyrimidine.",

      "explanation": "The glycosidic bond (specifically an N-glycosidic bond) connects the nitrogenous base to the 1' carbon of the pentose sugar.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Chargaff's rules state that in double-stranded DNA, adenine pairs with thymine (A=T) and guanine pairs with cytosine (G=C), so their amounts are equal. This also means that the total amount of purines equals the total amount of pyrimidines. These rules provided crucial evidence for the Watson-Crick model of DNA structure.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds, while guanine and cytosine form three hydrogen bonds.

        "D. the bases on each strand face opposite directions"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The two DNA strands are antiparallel, meaning they run in opposite directions. One strand runs 5' to 3' while the complementary strand runs 3' to 5'. This orientation is critical for DNA replication, as DNA polymerase can only synthesize DNA in the 5' to 3' direction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The major groove is wider and exposes more of the functional groups of the base pairs, allowing proteins like transcription factors to recognize specific DNA sequences without unwinding the helix.

        "D. RNA uses adenine while DNA uses a modified form of adenine"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "RNA contains ribose sugar with a 2'-hydroxyl group, while DNA contains 2'-deoxyribose lacking this hydroxyl group. This 2'-OH makes RNA more susceptible to hydrolysis and less stable than DNA. While RNA is often single-stranded, it can form double-stranded regions and complex secondary structures.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "rRNA is a ribozyme that provides the catalytic activity (peptidyl transferase) for peptide bond formation during translation.

      "explanation": "Okazaki fragments are short DNA segments (100-200 nucleotides in eukaryotes, 1000-2000 in prokaryotes) synthesized discontinuously on the lagging strand. Because DNA polymerase can only synthesize 5' to 3', and the lagging strand template runs 5' to 3', synthesis must occur in fragments that are later joined by DNA ligase.",
