      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Lysine has a pKa of approximately 10.5 for its side chain amino group, meaning it is protonated and positively charged at pH 7.4. Glutamate and aspartate are negatively charged at physiological pH due to their carboxyl side chains (pKa ~4). Alanine has a neutral side chain.",

      "explanation": "For basic amino acids, the pI is calculated as the average of the two highest pKa values (the two amino groups): pI = (9.0 + 10.5)/2 = 9.75. This ensures both amino groups are at their equilibrium point.",
