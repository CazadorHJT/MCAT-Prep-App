      "options": [
        "A. Fully active due to CAP binding",
        "B. Repressed because the repressor is bound to the operator",
        "C. Constitutively expressed",
        "D. Partially active due to low cAMP levels"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "When lactose is absent, the lac repressor protein binds to the operator region, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes. The repressor is normally active and only becomes inactive when it binds to allolactose (a lactose metabolite). Additionally, when glucose is present, cAMP levels are low, so CAP cannot bind to enhance transcription.",

        "D. Post-transcriptional regulation"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The lac operon exhibits both positive and negative regulation. Negative regulation occurs through the lac repressor, which blocks transcription when lactose is absent. Positive regulation occurs through CAP (catabolite activator protein), which enhances transcription when glucose is low and cAMP levels are high. Both mechanisms work together to fine-tune gene expression.",

        "D. Attenuator that stalls the ribosome"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the trp operon, tryptophan serves as a corepressor. The trp repressor protein is inactive by itself and cannot bind to the operator. When tryptophan levels are high, tryptophan binds to the repressor protein, activating it and allowing it to bind to the operator, thereby blocking transcription. This is an example of negative feedback regulation.",

        "D. cAMP"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Allolactose, an isomer of lactose, is the actual inducer that binds to the lac repressor and causes a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator. Lactose is first converted to allolactose by beta-galactosidase. Glucose affects CAP-mediated regulation, not the repressor directly. cAMP binds to CAP, not the repressor.",

        "D. The repressor is bound to the operator"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CAP requires cAMP to bind to DNA. When glucose is low, adenylate cyclase is active and produces high levels of cAMP. The cAMP-CAP complex binds to the CAP binding site upstream of the lac promoter, bending the DNA and enhancing RNA polymerase binding. When glucose is high, cAMP levels drop and CAP cannot bind, resulting in weak transcription even if lactose is present.",

        "D. Inhibition of translation initiation"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Attenuation is a regulatory mechanism unique to some bacterial operons. In the trp operon, the leader sequence contains regions that can form alternative stem-loop structures. When tryptophan is abundant, ribosomes translate quickly, causing formation of a terminator hairpin that stops transcription. When tryptophan is scarce, ribosomes stall, allowing an antiterminator structure to form, permitting full transcription.",

        "D. Expression only when lactose is absent"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "If the lac repressor is inactivated, it cannot bind to the operator to block transcription. This results in constitutive (continuous) expression of the lac operon genes regardless of whether lactose is present. However, maximum expression still requires CAP-cAMP binding when glucose is low. The operon would be expressed at basal levels even without lactose.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The lac operon contains three structural genes: lacZ encodes beta-galactosidase (cleaves lactose into glucose and galactose), lacY encodes permease (transports lactose into the cell), and lacA encodes transacetylase (transfers acetyl groups to lactose). These enzymes are needed for lactose metabolism.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "General transcription factors (GTFs) such as TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH are required for all RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. They help position RNA polymerase II at the promoter and form the preinitiation complex. TFIID binds to the TATA box, and the other factors assemble sequentially.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The TATA box, located approximately 25-30 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site, is recognized by TFIID. Specifically, the TBP (TATA-binding protein) subunit of TFIID binds to the TATA box, causing DNA bending and initiating assembly of the preinitiation complex. RNA polymerase II cannot bind DNA directly without the help of GTFs.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements that can be located thousands of base pairs upstream or downstream of the gene they regulate, or even within introns. They can function in either orientation. Enhancers bind specific transcription factors (activators) and interact with the promoter through DNA looping. Promoters are located at fixed positions near the transcription start site and are required for basal transcription.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Silencers are cis-regulatory DNA elements that decrease or prevent transcription when bound by repressor proteins. Like enhancers, silencers can function at various distances from the promoter. Repressor proteins bound to silencers can recruit corepressor complexes or interfere with the transcription machinery to reduce gene expression.",

        "D. Degrade mRNA after translation"

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The mediator complex is a large multiprotein complex that acts as a bridge between transcription factors bound to enhancers and the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex at the promoter. It allows signals from enhancer-bound activators to be transmitted to the basal transcription machinery, thereby regulating transcription initiation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "DNA looping is a mechanism that allows enhancers located far from their target genes to function. The DNA bends, bringing activator proteins bound to enhancers into direct contact with the transcription machinery at the promoter. This interaction is often stabilized by cohesin and other architectural proteins. This explains how enhancers can work over distances of thousands of base pairs.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Chromatin remodeling complexes use ATP hydrolysis to alter the position, composition, or conformation of nucleosomes. They can slide nucleosomes along DNA, evict nucleosomes, or exchange histone variants. This changes the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and the transcription machinery. Examples include the SWI/SNF and ISWI families of remodeling complexes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Histone acetylation involves the addition of acetyl groups to lysine residues on histone tails by histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Acetylation neutralizes the positive charge on lysines, reducing the interaction between histones and negatively charged DNA. This leads to a more open chromatin structure (euchromatin) that is accessible for transcription. Deacetylation by HDACs has the opposite effect.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from histone tails, restoring the positive charge on lysine residues. This increases the affinity between histones and DNA, leading to chromatin condensation and reduced accessibility for transcription factors. HDACs are often recruited by repressor complexes to silence gene expression. HDAC inhibitors are used as cancer therapies.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "DNA methylation occurs at the 5-position of cytosine residues, primarily in CpG dinucleotides. Methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions is associated with gene silencing. Methylated DNA can recruit methyl-binding proteins that bring in repressive chromatin remodeling complexes. DNA methylation is important in genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and silencing of transposable elements.",
