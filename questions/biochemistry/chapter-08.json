      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Beta-oxidation of fatty acids primarily occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. While peroxisomes can also perform beta-oxidation (especially for very long chain fatty acids), the majority of fatty acid oxidation takes place in mitochondria.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Each round of beta-oxidation cleaves a two-carbon unit as acetyl-CoA from the fatty acid chain and produces one NADH (from the dehydrogenation by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) and one FADH2 (from the dehydrogenation by beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase).

      "explanation": "Carnitine is required to transport long-chain fatty acyl-CoA across the inner mitochondrial membrane via the carnitine shuttle.

      "explanation": "Palmitate has 16 carbons and requires 7 rounds of beta-oxidation to be completely converted to 8 acetyl-CoA molecules. The formula is (n/2) - 1 rounds, where n is the number of carbons. So for palmitate: (16/2) - 1 = 7 rounds. The last round produces two acetyl-CoA molecules from a 4-carbon intermediate.",

      "explanation": "NADPH is the primary reducing equivalent used for fatty acid synthesis. It is generated mainly by the pentose phosphate pathway and the malic enzyme reaction.

Unlike acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetone cannot be converted back to acetyl-CoA and is metabolically a dead end. The fruity odor of acetone on the breath is a sign of ketoacidosis.",
