        "D. Primers"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "PCR requires DNA polymerase (specifically a thermostable polymerase like Taq), not RNA polymerase. The essential components of PCR are: DNA template, thermostable DNA polymerase, forward and reverse primers, dNTPs (deoxynucleotide triphosphates), and appropriate buffer with Mg2+ ions.",

        "C. Denaturation",
        "D. Ligation"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Denaturation is the first step of each PCR cycle, typically performed at 94-98 degrees Celsius. At this high temperature, the hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs break, causing the double-stranded DNA to separate into single strands. Annealing involves primer binding, and extension involves DNA synthesis.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The annealing temperature is typically set 3-5 degrees Celsius below the melting temperature (Tm) of the primers. The Tm depends on primer length, GC content, and salt concentration. Setting the correct annealing temperature ensures specific primer binding to the template while minimizing non-specific binding.",

      "explanation": "Taq polymerase, isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus, is thermostable and remains active even after exposure to the high temperatures (94-98 degrees Celsius) used in the denaturation step. E. coli DNA polymerase would be denatured at these temperatures. Notably, Taq polymerase lacks 3' to 5' proofreading activity.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "PCR amplification is exponential. After n cycles, the theoretical yield is 2^n copies of the target sequence. After 20 cycles, this equals 2^20 = 1,048,576 copies, approximately one million. This exponential amplification is what makes PCR such a powerful technique for detecting small amounts of DNA.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "DNA is negatively charged due to its phosphate backbone. Each phosphate group carries a negative charge at physiological pH.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA fragments are separated primarily based on their size (molecular weight). Smaller fragments migrate faster through the gel matrix than larger fragments because they encounter less resistance.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Higher percentage agarose gels have smaller pore sizes and provide better resolution for smaller DNA fragments. A 2% gel is optimal for separating fragments in the 100-500 bp range. Lower percentage gels (0.5-1%) are better for larger fragments (1-20 kb), while very high percentages (3%+) may be too restrictive.",

      "explanation": "Ethidium bromide (EtBr) is a fluorescent dye that intercalates between the stacked base pairs of DNA. When exposed to UV light, the EtBr-DNA complex fluoresces orange-pink, allowing visualization of DNA bands. EtBr is a mutagen and should be handled with care. SYBR Safe is a less toxic alternative.",
