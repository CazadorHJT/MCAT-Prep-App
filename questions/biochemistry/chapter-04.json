        "A. Contains one carbon-carbon double bond",
        "B. Contains no carbon-carbon double bonds",
        "C. Contains multiple carbon-carbon double bonds",
        "D. Contains a carboxyl group at each end"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A saturated fatty acid contains no carbon-carbon double bonds in its hydrocarbon chain. The term 'saturated' refers to the fact that each carbon is bonded to the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible. Unsaturated fatty acids contain one (monounsaturated) or more (polyunsaturated) double bonds. All fatty acids have only one carboxyl group at one end.",

        "A. They increase the melting point by allowing tighter packing",

        "C. They have no effect on melting point",
        "D. They increase solubility in water"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids create kinks or bends in the hydrocarbon chain, preventing the molecules from packing tightly together. This reduced packing leads to weaker van der Waals forces between molecules, resulting in a lower melting point. This is why unsaturated fats (like olive oil) are liquid at room temperature while saturated fats (like butter) are solid.",

        "D. One fatty acid and one cholesterol molecule"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Triacylglycerols (also called triglycerides) consist of one glycerol molecule esterified to three fatty acid chains. Each of the three hydroxyl groups on glycerol forms an ester bond with the carboxyl group of a fatty acid. This structure makes triacylglycerols highly hydrophobic and efficient for energy storage.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Fatty acids are linked to glycerol through ester bonds, formed by a condensation reaction between the carboxyl group of the fatty acid and a hydroxyl group of glycerol, releasing water. Peptide bonds link amino acids in proteins. Glycosidic bonds link sugars in carbohydrates. Phosphodiester bonds link nucleotides in nucleic acids.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Triacylglycerols serve as the primary form of long-term energy storage in animals, stored in adipose tissue. They provide more energy per gram than carbohydrates or proteins (about 9 kcal/g vs 4 kcal/g) because they are more reduced and anhydrous. Phospholipids and cholesterol serve structural roles in membranes, while other lipids like eicosanoids function in cell signaling.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Phospholipids have two fatty acid chains esterified to glycerol (positions 1 and 2), while position 3 is occupied by a phosphate group often linked to an additional polar molecule (such as choline, serine, or ethanolamine). This structure makes phospholipids amphipathic, with a hydrophobic tail region and a hydrophilic head group, unlike the completely hydrophobic triacylglycerols.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Phospholipids are amphipathic, meaning they have both hydrophobic (fatty acid tails) and hydrophilic (phosphate head group) regions. This property allows them to spontaneously form bilayers in aqueous environments, with the hydrophobic tails facing inward and hydrophilic heads facing outward toward the water. This arrangement is the foundation of all biological membranes.",

      "explanation": "Cholesterol is a steroid, characterized by its four fused ring structure (three six-membered rings and one five-membered ring).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "According to the fluid mosaic model proposed by Singer and Nicolson, membrane proteins can move laterally within the lipid bilayer, giving the membrane its fluid nature. Proteins can be peripheral (attached to surface) or integral (spanning the membrane). The 'mosaic' refers to the diverse array of proteins embedded in the phospholipid bilayer.",

      "explanation": "HDL (high-density lipoprotein) has the highest protein-to-lipid ratio, which accounts for its high density. The protein content of lipoproteins increases in the order: chylomicrons < VLDL < LDL < HDL. HDL contains approximately 50% protein, while chylomicrons contain only about 2% protein.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is often called 'bad cholesterol' because elevated LDL levels are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. LDL delivers cholesterol to peripheral tissues and can deposit cholesterol in arterial walls. HDL is called 'good cholesterol' because it removes cholesterol from tissues and returns it to the liver.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Bile salts are amphipathic molecules that emulsify large fat globules into smaller droplets, greatly increasing the surface area available for pancreatic lipase to act upon. Bile salts do not have enzymatic activity themselves but are essential for efficient lipid digestion. They are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and stored in the gallbladder.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The correct order from largest to smallest is: Chylomicrons > VLDL > LDL > HDL. Chylomicrons are the largest and least dense (most lipid-rich), while HDL are the smallest and most dense (most protein-rich). This inverse relationship between size and density reflects the varying lipid-to-protein ratios.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A cis double bond creates a bend or kink of approximately 30 degrees in the fatty acid chain because the hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond. This is in contrast to trans double bonds, which allow a more extended, straight chain conformation. Most naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids have cis double bonds.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The omega (or n-) nomenclature counts carbons from the methyl (omega) end of the fatty acid. An omega-9 fatty acid has its first double bond 9 carbons from the methyl end. This is different from the delta (Δ) nomenclature, which counts from the carboxyl end. Oleic acid (18:1Δ9 or 18:1ω-9) has its double bond between carbons 9 and 10 from the carboxyl end.",

      "explanation": "Humans can synthesize saturated fatty acids and can introduce double bonds at positions Δ4, Δ5, Δ6, and Δ9, but lack desaturases that can introduce double bonds beyond carbon 9 from the carboxyl end.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Linoleic acid (18:2) is polyunsaturated because it contains two double bonds, as indicated by the '2' in its shorthand notation. Stearic acid (18:0) and palmitic acid (16:0) are saturated (no double bonds). Oleic acid (18:1) is monounsaturated (one double bond). Polyunsaturated means two or more double bonds.",

      "explanation": "Membrane fluidity is increased by unsaturated fatty acids because their kinked chains prevent tight packing of phospholipids.
