        "D. increasing the free energy change of the reaction"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Enzymes are biological catalysts that increase reaction rates by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. They do not alter the equilibrium constant or the overall free energy change (delta G) of the reaction. The reaction reaches equilibrium faster, but the final equilibrium position remains unchanged.",

        "D. the site where allosteric regulators bind"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The active site is a specific three-dimensional pocket or cleft within the enzyme where substrate molecules bind and the chemical reaction is catalyzed. It represents only a small portion of the total enzyme surface and contains amino acid residues that are critical for both substrate binding and catalytic activity.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The lock and key model, proposed by Emil Fischer, suggests that the substrate has a complementary shape to the enzyme's active site, much like a key fits into a lock. This model explains enzyme specificity but does not account for conformational changes. The induced fit model later refined this concept by proposing that enzymes can change shape upon substrate binding.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The induced fit model proposes that when a substrate binds to an enzyme, the enzyme undergoes a conformational change that results in a tighter, more complementary fit between the enzyme and substrate. This conformational change can help position catalytic residues optimally and may also destabilize the substrate, facilitating the reaction.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Enzymes are true catalysts and emerge unchanged after catalyzing a reaction. They can participate in multiple reaction cycles without being consumed. While enzymes are often specific for particular reactions, they do not shift the equilibrium position - they only increase the rate at which equilibrium is achieved.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Km is defined as the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of the maximum velocity (Vmax). It is a measure of the affinity of an enzyme for its substrate - a lower Km indicates higher affinity, meaning less substrate is needed to achieve half-maximal velocity.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A low Km indicates that the enzyme achieves half-maximal velocity at a low substrate concentration, meaning it binds substrate efficiently and has high affinity. Conversely, a high Km indicates low affinity, requiring more substrate to achieve the same velocity. Km is inversely related to substrate affinity.",

        "D. the rate of enzyme synthesis"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Vmax is the maximum velocity of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, achieved when all enzyme active sites are saturated with substrate. At this point, increasing substrate concentration further will not increase the reaction rate. Vmax depends on the total enzyme concentration and the catalytic rate constant (kcat).",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site and compete with substrate for binding. Because competitive inhibition can be overcome by adding excess substrate, Vmax remains unchanged. However, more substrate is required to reach half-maximal velocity, so the apparent Km increases. This is a key distinguishing feature of competitive inhibition.",

      "explanation": "Cofactors are non-protein molecules that are required for the catalytic activity of certain enzymes. They can be metal ions (such as Zn2+, Mg2+, or Fe2+) or organic molecules called coenzymes. Without their cofactors, these enzymes (called apoenzymes) are catalytically inactive.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Allosteric enzymes display sigmoidal (S-shaped) kinetics rather than the hyperbolic kinetics predicted by the Michaelis-Menten equation. This is due to cooperativity between subunits - binding of substrate to one subunit affects the affinity of other subunits. Allosteric enzymes typically have multiple subunits and can be regulated by activators and inhibitors binding at allosteric sites.",

      "explanation": "Niacin (vitamin B3) is the precursor for the synthesis of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP+, which are essential coenzymes in redox reactions. Thiamine is a precursor for TPP, riboflavin for FAD, and pyridoxine for PLP. Each B vitamin gives rise to specific coenzymes with distinct functions.",

      "explanation": "In the Michaelis-Menten mechanism, ES represents the enzyme-substrate complex formed when substrate (S) binds to the enzyme (E). The basic mechanism is: E + S <-> ES -> E + P, where P is the product. The ES complex is the intermediate state before product formation and release.",

      "explanation": "Transferases catalyze the transfer of functional groups (such as amino, phosphate, or methyl groups) from one molecule to another. Oxidoreductases catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, hydrolases catalyze hydrolysis reactions, and lyases catalyze the addition or removal of groups to form double bonds.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Michaelis-Menten enzymes display hyperbolic kinetics when velocity is plotted against substrate concentration. At low [S], velocity increases nearly linearly with substrate. As [S] increases, the curve levels off as enzymes become saturated, approaching Vmax asymptotically. This hyperbolic relationship is characteristic of simple enzyme kinetics.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Uncompetitive inhibitors bind only to the enzyme-substrate (ES) complex, not to free enzyme. This binding removes ES from equilibrium, causing both apparent Km and Vmax to decrease by the same factor. The ratio Vmax/Km remains constant. Competitive inhibitors increase Km without changing Vmax, while noncompetitive inhibitors decrease Vmax without changing Km.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In competitive inhibition, Vmax remains unchanged while apparent Km increases. On a Lineweaver-Burk plot, this means the y-intercept (1/Vmax) stays the same, so the lines for inhibited and uninhibited reactions intersect on the y-axis. The x-intercept (-1/Km) moves closer to zero (becomes less negative) with inhibitor.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Noncompetitive inhibitors bind to a site other than the active site and can bind to either free enzyme or the ES complex with equal affinity.

It takes into account both the rate of catalysis (kcat) and the enzyme's affinity for substrate (Km). A higher kcat/Km indicates a more efficient enzyme.
