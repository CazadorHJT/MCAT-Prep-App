      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "When a reaction releases heat to the surroundings, it is classified as exothermic. By convention, heat released by the system is assigned a negative sign, so ΔH < 0 for exothermic reactions. The system loses energy to the surroundings.",

      "explanation": "The standard enthalpy of formation for any element in its most stable form (standard state) at standard conditions is defined as zero. O₂(g) is the most stable form of oxygen at 25°C and 1 atm, so ΔHf° = 0 kJ/mol.",
