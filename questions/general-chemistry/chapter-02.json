      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Sodium (Na) is an alkali metal with low electronegativity (0.93), while chlorine has high electronegativity (3.16). The large electronegativity difference (>1.7) between sodium and chlorine leads to ionic bond formation. Sodium readily loses one electron to form Na+, while chlorine gains one electron to form Cl-, resulting in the ionic compound NaCl.",

      "explanation": "Formal charge = valence electrons - (lone pair electrons + 1/2 bonding electrons). For nitrogen in NH4+: valence electrons = 5, lone pair electrons = 0, bonding electrons = 8 (four bonds). Formal charge = 5 - (0 + 4) = +1.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In ethene, each carbon atom forms three sigma bonds (two C-H and one C-C) and one pi bond (the double bond).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Water exhibits strong hydrogen bonding because oxygen is highly electronegative and small, allowing strong O-H---O interactions. Sulfur is less electronegative and larger, so H2S cannot form effective hydrogen bonds. This explains why water (bp 100°C) boils at a much higher temperature than H2S (bp -60°C).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "London dispersion forces arise from temporary, instantaneous dipoles caused by the random movement of electrons. These temporary dipoles induce dipoles in neighboring molecules, creating an attractive force.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Ionic compounds are generally insoluble in nonpolar solvents because the strong electrostatic forces between ions cannot be overcome by weak interactions with nonpolar solvent molecules.

      "explanation": "Bond order represents the number of chemical bonds between a pair of atoms. A triple bond consists of one sigma bond and two pi bonds, giving a bond order of 3. Higher bond orders correlate with shorter, stronger bonds. Examples include N2 and acetylene (C2H2).",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "CHCl3 (chloroform) has a net dipole moment because the three C-Cl bond dipoles do not cancel out due to the tetrahedral geometry with one hydrogen. CCl4 and CH4 are tetrahedral with symmetrically arranged atoms, so their bond dipoles cancel. CO2 is linear and symmetrical, so its bond dipoles also cancel.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The carbonate ion (CO3^2-) has three resonance structures, each with the double bond on a different oxygen.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In acetylene, each carbon forms two sigma bonds (one C-H and one C-C) and two pi bonds (the triple bond). This requires sp hybridization, leaving two unhybridized p orbitals for pi bonding. The geometry is linear with 180-degree bond angles.",

      "correct_answer": "B",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In ammonia, the lone pair on nitrogen occupies more space than bonding pairs because it is held closer to the nucleus and spread over a larger region. This increased lone pair-bonding pair repulsion compresses the H-N-H bond angles from the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5 degrees to approximately 107 degrees.",

      "explanation": "SF4 has four bonding pairs and one lone pair on sulfur, giving five electron domains. Five electron domains adopt a trigonal bipyramidal electron domain geometry.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In PCl5, phosphorus is bonded to five chlorine atoms, requiring 10 electrons in its valence shell.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Methanol has hydrogen bonding capability due to its O-H group, which is much stronger than the dipole-dipole forces in fluoromethane or the London dispersion forces in ethane and propane. Hydrogen bonding requires more energy to overcome, resulting in a higher boiling point (65°C for methanol vs. -89°C for ethane).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lattice energy is proportional to the product of ionic charges and inversely proportional to the distance between ions (related to ionic radii).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In diamond, each carbon is sp3 hybridized and bonded to four other carbons in a rigid 3D tetrahedral network. In graphite, sp2 hybridized carbons form planar sheets held together by weak London dispersion forces, allowing layers to slide over each other. The continuous 3D covalent bonding in diamond makes it extremely hard.",
