      "correct_answer": "B",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Both Na and Mg have their valence electrons in the 3s orbital. However, Mg has 12 protons vs Na's 11, resulting in a higher effective nuclear charge. This makes Mg's valence electron more tightly held, requiring more energy to remove.",

      "explanation": "Counting electrons: [Ne] = 10 electrons, plus 3s^2 (2) plus 3p^5 (5) = 17 electrons total. Element 17 is chlorine. Chlorine needs one more electron to achieve a noble gas configuration.",

      "explanation": "The Aufbau principle states electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy. Using the (n + l) rule: 4s (4+0=4), then 3d (3+2=5), then 4p (4+1=5). Since 3d and 4p have the same n+l sum, the one with lower n (3d) fills first.",
