      "options": ["A. The bell", "B. The food", "C. Salivation to the bell", "D. Salivation to food"],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The unconditioned stimulus (US) is a stimulus that naturally and automatically triggers a response without prior learning. In Pavlov's experiments, food naturally caused the dogs to salivate, making it the unconditioned stimulus. The bell was the conditioned stimulus (CS), and salivation to the bell was the conditioned response (CR).",

      "options": ["A. Stimulus discrimination", "B. Stimulus generalization", "C. Spontaneous recovery", "D. Higher-order conditioning"],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Stimulus generalization occurs when a conditioned response is elicited by stimuli similar to the original conditioned stimulus. The child's anxiety response has generalized from the specific dog that bit her to all dogs. Stimulus discrimination would involve responding differently to similar stimuli.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Spontaneous recovery refers to the reappearance of an extinguished conditioned response after a period of rest. This suggests that extinction does not completely erase the learned association but rather suppresses it. The recovered response is typically weaker than the original conditioned response.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Operant conditioning involves learning through consequences. The rat's behavior (lever pressing) is strengthened because it is followed by a reinforcer (food).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Negative reinforcement involves the removal of an aversive stimulus to increase a behavior. Taking aspirin removes the unpleasant headache, which increases the likelihood of taking aspirin again in the future.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Variable ratio schedules provide reinforcement after an unpredictable number of responses. Slot machines exemplify this schedule, paying out after varying numbers of plays. This schedule produces high, steady rates of responding and is highly resistant to extinction, which is why gambling can be so addictive.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Fixed interval schedules produce a characteristic scalloped pattern of responding. After receiving reinforcement, the organism typically pauses, then gradually increases responding as the time for the next reinforcement approaches.

      "explanation": "Bandura's Bobo doll experiment demonstrated observational learning (social learning). Children who observed adults acting aggressively toward the Bobo doll were significantly more likely to imitate that aggressive behavior, even without direct reinforcement.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Bandura identified four components necessary for observational learning: attention (noticing the behavior), retention (remembering the behavior), reproduction (ability to perform the behavior), and motivation (desire to perform the behavior). Direct reinforcement is not required; learning can occur through observation alone, though reinforcement may affect whether the behavior is performed.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Encoding is the first stage of memory processing, involving the conversion of sensory input into a form that can be processed and stored by the memory system. Storage refers to maintaining information over time, and retrieval is accessing stored information. Consolidation is the process of stabilizing memories after initial encoding.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Iconic memory is the sensory memory for visual information, lasting about 0.5 seconds. Echoic memory is sensory memory for auditory information, lasting 3-4 seconds. Working memory is a form of short-term memory that actively processes information. Episodic memory is a type of long-term memory for personal experiences.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Short-term memory (STM) has a limited duration of approximately 15-30 seconds without rehearsal. Information in STM will decay unless it is actively rehearsed or encoded into long-term memory. Sensory memory lasts much shorter (milliseconds to seconds), while long-term memory can last indefinitely.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "George Miller's famous 1956 paper 'The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two' established that short-term memory capacity is approximately 7 items (ranging from 5 to 9).

      "explanation": "Episodic memory is the type of explicit (declarative) long-term memory that stores personal experiences and specific events, including the time and place they occurred.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The hippocampus is critical for the formation of new explicit (declarative) memories, including episodic and semantic memories. Damage to the hippocampus typically results in anterograde amnesia, the inability to form new explicit memories.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Context-dependent learning refers to the phenomenon where recall is enhanced when the external environment during retrieval matches the environment during encoding. State-dependent learning specifically refers to internal states (mood, drug state). Encoding specificity is a broader principle encompassing both context and state-dependent effects.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "State-dependent learning occurs when memory retrieval is enhanced when the internal physiological or psychological state matches the state during encoding. The caffeine creates an internal state that, when matched during testing, facilitates recall. Context-dependent learning refers to external environmental cues rather than internal states.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Proactive interference occurs when older memories interfere with the retrieval of newer memories (old disrupts new).

      "explanation": "Retroactive interference occurs when newly learned information interferes with the recall of previously learned information (new disrupts old).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Decay theory proposes that memories fade or deteriorate over time due to the natural decay of memory traces in the brain. Without rehearsal or use, the physical or chemical changes in the brain that represent memories gradually weaken.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Retrieval failure occurs when information is stored in long-term memory but cannot be accessed due to inadequate or inappropriate retrieval cues. The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon is a common example. The memory exists but cannot be retrieved without proper cues.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Recognition tasks are generally easier than recall tasks because recognition provides retrieval cues (the items themselves), while recall requires generating information with minimal cues. This difference is why multiple-choice tests are often easier than fill-in-the-blank tests. The memory is present but requires cues for retrieval.",

      "options": ["A. Acquisition", "B. Generalization", "C. Spontaneous recovery", "D. Second-order conditioning"],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This describes spontaneous recovery, the reappearance of an extinguished conditioned response after a rest period. The fear response to the tone was extinguished through repeated presentations without the shock, but after rest, the fear partially returns.

      "explanation": "Variable ratio schedules produce the highest and most consistent rates of responding.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Fixed ratio schedules provide reinforcement after a fixed number of responses. Being paid for every 10 widgets is a fixed ratio of 10:1 (FR-10).

Shallow processing (focusing on physical features) produces weaker memories than deep processing (focusing on meaning and associations).
